# Spawner3

A game on the basics of project activities at the university.

## Story

Once, during one lesson on “Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures”, Pavel Rostislavovich decided to talk about his problem. Spawner2 stopped working for him! Since Pavel is a very busy person, he decided to give his students a task: to create Spawner3. You, as one of them, decided to take it seriously and went to Mount Pidan. Mount Pidan is the place where many mythical artifacts are found. The future Spawner must last a long time and without the use of materials such as money tree or science granite, this will not be possible. You will meet the inhabitants of Pidan and create Spawner3 almost from scratch. You have your pick and ax with you. Forward, towards enlightenment!

## Missed opportunities

In the game, you can add animation to magic sprites if you add them to the `animation` folder. However, drawing animation requires time, which we don’t have.
